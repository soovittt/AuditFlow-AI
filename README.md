AuditFlow-AI

AuditFlow-AI is an experimental project exploring how artificial intelligence can streamline compliance, audits, and documentation workflows. Originally developed for a hackathon, the project has grown into a foundation for building open-source audit automation tools that connect with developer workflows and cloud infrastructure.

The mission is simple:
👉 Make audits effortless.
👉 Catch security drift automatically.
👉 Keep teams audit-ready, always.

🚀 Vision

Audits today are manual, repetitive, and painful. We believe compliance can be reimagined with AI and modern developer tools. AuditFlow-AI is designed to:

Automate evidence collection – Pull relevant compliance artifacts from source control, CI/CD, and cloud providers.

Detect security & configuration drift – Continuously monitor infrastructure for deviations that impact compliance.

Generate audit-ready documentation – Turn raw logs and configs into structured, human-readable reports.

Integrate with developer workflows – GitLab/GitHub, GCP/AWS, and beyond.

Long term, we aim to make AuditFlow-AI a community-driven open-source framework for compliance automation that any company can adopt and extend.

⚡️ Features (Current & Planned)

✅ GitLab integration for metadata and CI/CD pipelines

✅ AI-powered summarization of compliance evidence

✅ Security drift detection from cloud configurations

🛠️ CLI for developer-first workflows

🛠️ Web dashboard for compliance visibility

🛠️ Plugin ecosystem for new providers & standards (SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, etc.)

🏗️ Tech Stack

Backend: FastAPI / Python

Frontend: Next.js

Infra: Google Cloud

Database: Postgres + Vector DB (Pinecone)

AI: LLM-powered summarization and document generation

🌍 Open Source Future

AuditFlow-AI will be open-sourced to:

Empower startups and enterprises to take compliance into their own hands

Provide transparency in how audit evidence is collected and reported

Enable contributors to build modules for specific industries or frameworks

We see this project as part of a larger movement toward developer-friendly compliance, where audits don’t slow innovation but accelerate trust.

🤝 Contributing (Coming Soon)

We’ll soon publish contribution guidelines and a roadmap. The goal is to grow a community of engineers, security practitioners, and compliance experts building together.

📜 License

Planned to be released under the Apache 2.0 License (subject to finalization).

🙌 Acknowledgments

AuditFlow-AI was first built during a hackathon project, inspired by the challenges of staying audit-ready in fast-moving engineering teams. Thanks to everyone who tested, provided feedback, and shaped the early direction.
