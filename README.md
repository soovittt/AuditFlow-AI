**AuditFlow-AI** is an experimental platform to automate compliance evidence collection, detect configuration/security drift, and generate audit-ready documentation from your DevOps footprint. Built initially for a hackathon, it’s evolving toward a community-driven, open-source framework.

> **Mission:** Make audits effortless • Catch drift automatically • Keep teams audit-ready, always.

## Vision
Audits today are manual and repetitive. AuditFlow-AI reimagines compliance as code + automation:

- **Automated evidence collection** from source control, CI/CD, and cloud accounts.
- **Continuous drift detection** for infra, policies, and access controls.
- **Audit-ready packs** that compile artifacts into clean, human-readable reports.
- **Developer-first**: works with Git-centric flows and modern cloud tooling.

Long term, AuditFlow-AI aims to be a **modular open-source framework** you can extend for SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, and more.

## Key Capabilities
- **Evidence Graph (prototype):** Ingests GitLab metadata, CI runs, IaC state, and cloud configs into a queryable model.
- **Drift Rules:** Declarative checks that alert on deviations impacting compliance.
- **Report Generator:** Turns raw logs/configs into structured findings and narratives.
- **CLI + Web UI (planned):** Dev-first commands plus a lightweight dashboard.

> Status: Early prototype; APIs and schemas are subject to change.
